# Graduation Rates in the Tri-state area

**Author**: [Becky Strickland]


## Business Problem

Predict which schools have high and which schools have low high school graduation rates. Identify which characteristics are the best indicator of high and low graduation rates so that school districts know where to focus resources when attempting to increase high school graduation rates.
